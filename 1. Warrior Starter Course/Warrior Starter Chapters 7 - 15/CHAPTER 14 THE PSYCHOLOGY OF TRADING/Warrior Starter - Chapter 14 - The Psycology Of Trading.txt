An often underestimated aspect of trading, psychology plays a HUGE role in the process. As traders, our emotions can factor into our decisions every second at our trading station. To be a master of trading, you also need to be a master of your emotions.

It is important to check in with the state of your body and your mind before the bell rings and as you trade, so that you can adjust your strategy if needed. Lacking sleep? Maybe you should take smaller share sizes. Still angry about your last trade? Consider stepping away to compose yourself, or finish up early for the day.

Acknowledging your emotions will help prevent you from common emotional mistakes like revenge trading and FOMO (fear of missing out). We explore these concepts and how to better manage your thoughts and emotions in our weekly "FOMO Friday" mentoring sessions that are included in our Warrior Pro Program.
