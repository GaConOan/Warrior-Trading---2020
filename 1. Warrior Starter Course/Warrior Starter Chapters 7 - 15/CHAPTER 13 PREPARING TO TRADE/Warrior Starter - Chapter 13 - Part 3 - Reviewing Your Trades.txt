Deciding to track my trades in my Excel spreadsheet earlier on in my trading career resulted in a huge turning point. It allowed me to realize the types of trades that I was profiting on, and the types of trades that resulted in losses. It is because I spent the extra time to understand my own trading habits that I was eventually able to establish my trading strategy that I now share with my students.

Even traders like you who will be learning a proven strategy should still track their trades! Every trader is different, and what works for someone else may not work for you.

Tracking your trades and understanding your metrics will allow you to pinpoint your hottest time of day, the types of stocks that give you the biggest returns, the strategies and patterns that you are good at trading, and those that you might need more practice with.
