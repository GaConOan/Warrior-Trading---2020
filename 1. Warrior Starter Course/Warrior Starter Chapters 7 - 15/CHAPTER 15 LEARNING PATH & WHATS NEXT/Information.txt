You've made it to the final chapter of the Warrior Starter Course! Congratulations! You might be asking: what's next?

In this video, we'll talk about where you can go from here, and talk about what we've discovered from the students who came before you.

To be a successful trader, you only have to be a Master of One, meaning that you do not have to master ALL trading strategies--just find the best strategy for you and master it.

To help guide you towards the best trading path for you, we have created the "New Trader Assessment" (also referred to as the "Warrior Starter Quiz"). You can find it after this video! Just click the right-facing arrow above > .
