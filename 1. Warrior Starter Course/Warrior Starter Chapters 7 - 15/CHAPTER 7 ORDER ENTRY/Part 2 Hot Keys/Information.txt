Using hot keys to place orders is an essential part of some trading strategies, particularly day trading which requires quick executions.

In this video, I'll use the Warrior Trading Simulator and Lightspeed Trader to demonstrate how to use hot keys, and I'll talk about some of the most important hot keys that I use and those I don't recommend using.

Please note that we also have extensive support articles and videos about hot keys in the simulator platform here in our solutions articles.
